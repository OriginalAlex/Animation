# Animation

This is a program I threw together where the user can communicate with an easy-to-use GUI and design an animation frame-by-frame.
Of course this involves file-writing/reading for storage of the Animation.

Please do tell me if there's anything I could do better (I'm sure there is) as this is one of my first projects.

Thanks,
